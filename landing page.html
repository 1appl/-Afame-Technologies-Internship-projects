               <h3>Title : GLAUCOMA DETECTION USING CNN MODEL</h3>
                <p> Glaucoma is a condition that affects how well the human eye can see. This illness, 
                    which causes eyesight degeneration, is regarded as an irreversible condition. One of the 
                    most prevalent metabolic disorders (DMs), diabetes mellitus affects healthy living 
                    globally and can have mild to severe secondary consequences. Diabetic retinopathy 
                    (DR), which harms the retina and may result in vision loss, is one of the secondary 
                    consequences of DM. For the correct identification of glaucoma and diabetic 
                    retinopathy, many deep learning (DL) models have so far been created. The 
                    convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the paper to offer an architecture for 
                    accurate glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy detection based on machine learning. The 
                    CNN model trained in the project achieved a accuracy of 92% on the test set indicating 
                    effectiveness of detecting eye diseases. </p>
